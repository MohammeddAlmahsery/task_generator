  "## Project Overview": "Project Name: Nexus - Centralized Internal Tool Dashboard\nDocumentation Source: Project \"Nexus\" v1.0\n\nSummary:\nProject Nexus aims to develop a unified web dashboard to aggregate Acme Corp's disparate internal tools (HR, IT, Finance) into a single, cohesive portal. The goal is to improve employee productivity and user experience through Single Sign-On (SSO), a customizable widget-based dashboard, and centralized administration. The technical stack is built on React, Django, PostgreSQL, and is deployed on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes (EKS), with a CI/CD pipeline managed by GitHub Actions.",
  "## Intern Profile": "Name: Alex Chen\n\nBackground Summary:\n- A Computer Science student with a strong specialization in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and automated testing.\n- Possesses hands-on experience with the project's core technologies, including Python, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, and GitHub Actions.\n- Has developed personal projects focused on building multi-stage CI/CD pipelines with integrated testing (Pytest, SonarQube) and validating Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Checkov).",
  "## Task Assignment": "Task Title: Enhance CI/CD Pipeline with Automated Backend Integration Testing\n\nDescription:\nThis task involves designing and implementing a robust, automated integration test suite for the Nexus backend API. The intern will use Pytest to write tests that validate key API endpoints (e.g., authentication, dashboard data retrieval). These tests will be containerized using Docker and integrated as a mandatory check within the existing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that new code is verified automatically before deployment.\n\nObjective:\nTo improve the reliability and quality of the backend service by creating an automated testing gate in the deployment pipeline. This will prevent regressions, validate API functionality, and enforce quality standards for all code changes.\n\nComplexity Level: Intermediate\nExpected Duration: 3 Weeks",
  "## Learning Opportunities": "- Gain practical experience applying Pytest for API testing in a professional Django REST Framework project.\n- Learn to integrate and manage automated testing within a production-level CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.\n- Deepen understanding of containerized testing strategies by using Docker to create isolated test environments.\n- Collaborate with a development team and participate in the code review process, enhancing skills in writing clean, maintainable test code.",
  "## Step-by-Step Plan": "1. Preparation Stage (Week 1)\n   - Review the Project \"Nexus\" technical documentation, focusing on the Backend (Django) and CI/CD (GitHub Actions) sections.\n   - Set up the local development environment for the backend service using Docker.\n   - Gain read-only access to the project's GitHub repository and familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and API structure.\n2. Exploration Stage (Week 1)\n   - Analyze the key API endpoints defined in the documentation (`/api/auth/login/`, `/api/dashboard/`, etc.).\n   - Identify critical test cases, including successful data retrieval, handling of different user roles (admin, manager), and error responses for invalid requests.\n   - Outline a test plan document for review with the project mentor.\n3. Implementation Stage (Week 2)\n   - Create a `tests/` directory within the backend Django project.\n   - Write integration tests using Pytest to cover the test cases identified in the exploration stage. Use Pytest fixtures to manage test data and setup.\n   - Develop a `Dockerfile.test` that builds a container image specifically for running the test suite.\n4. Testing & Feedback Stage (Week 3)\n   - Modify the `github-actions.yml` workflow file to add a new step in the `test` job.\n   - This step will use the `Dockerfile.test` to build the test environment and execute the Pytest suite against a test database.\n   - Ensure the CI pipeline correctly fails if any of the integration tests fail. Submit a Pull Request with the changes for team review.\n5. Delivery Stage (Week 3)\n   - Incorporate feedback from the code review and ensure all tests are passing in the CI pipeline.\n   - Merge the approved Pull Request into the `main` branch.\n   - Create a brief document in the project's repository explaining how to run the tests locally and how they operate within the pipeline.",
  "## Next Steps\n": "- Schedule a kickoff meeting with Alex and his assigned mentor to review this task report and answer any initial questions.\n- Provide Alex with the necessary permissions to the project's GitHub repository.\n- Assign a first simple task, such as setting up the local environment, to ensure the setup process is smooth.",
