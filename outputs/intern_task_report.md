  "## Project Overview": "Project Name: Nexus - Centralized Internal Tool Dashboard\nDocumentation Source: Project Documentation PDF (Version 1.0)\n\nSummary:\nProject Nexus aims to develop a unified, web-based dashboard to consolidate all of Acme Corp's internal tools (e.g., Leave Tracker, Ticket System). The goal is to improve employee productivity and user experience by providing a single portal with Single Sign-On (SSO) and a consistent interface. The technical stack is built on React, Django, PostgreSQL, and is deployed on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes.",
  "## Intern Profile": "Name: Alex Chen\n\nBackground Summary:\n- A Computer Science student with a strong specialization in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD automation.\n- Possesses practical experience with key project technologies including AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitHub Actions.\n- Demonstrates a keen interest and proven project experience in integrating robust testing methodologies (Pytest, static analysis) into automated pipelines.",
  "## Task Assignment": "Task Title: Enhance the Nexus Backend CI/CD Pipeline with Automated Multi-Stage Testing\n\nDescription:\nThis task involves augmenting the existing GitHub Actions workflow for the Nexus Django backend. The intern will add distinct, automated stages for static code analysis, unit testing with coverage reporting, and integration testing that runs against a live, containerized test database. The pipeline must be configured to fail and block deployment if any of these quality gates do not pass.\n\nObjective:\nTo improve the reliability and quality of the backend service by automating development standards enforcement. This will reduce the likelihood of bugs reaching the staging environment and provide developers with immediate feedback on their commits.\n\nComplexity Level: Medium\nExpected Duration: 3 Weeks",
  "## Learning Opportunities": "- Gain practical experience with a production-grade CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.\n- Apply knowledge of testing frameworks (Pytest) in a professional microservices architecture.\n- Learn to configure and manage service containers (PostgreSQL) within an automated CI environment.\n- Understand secure secret management for CI/CD processes in a cloud environment (AWS/EKS).",
  "## Step-by-Step Plan": "1. Preparation Stage\n   - Gain read-only access to the Nexus backend GitHub repository.\n   - Review the existing Django codebase, Pytest unit tests, and the current `.github/workflows/main.yml` file.\n   - Set up the project locally using the provided Docker configuration to understand the service dependencies.\n2. Exploration Stage\n   - Identify appropriate Python libraries for static code analysis (e.g., Flake8) and code coverage (e.g., coverage.py).\n   - Research the GitHub Actions syntax for setting up a service container for PostgreSQL.\n   - Formulate a plan to modify the YAML workflow to include the new testing stages without disrupting the existing build and deploy jobs.\n3. Implementation Stage\n   - Create a new feature branch for the pipeline enhancements.\n   - Modify the GitHub Actions workflow file to add steps for:\n     - Installing dependencies and running static code analysis.\n     - Executing the unit test suite with Pytest and generating a code coverage report.\n     - Launching a PostgreSQL service container, running database migrations, and executing integration tests.\n   - Ensure each step is configured to fail the workflow upon any errors.\n4. Testing & Feedback Stage\n   - Push commits to the feature branch to trigger the new workflow and validate that all steps execute successfully.\n   - Intentionally introduce code that violates quality checks (e.g., a syntax error, a failing test) to confirm that the pipeline correctly fails.\n   - Submit a Pull Request for review by the lead DevOps engineer and incorporate any feedback.\n5. Delivery Stage\n   - Once the Pull Request is approved, merge it into the `main` branch.\n   - Monitor the workflow's first few runs on the `main` branch to ensure stability.\n   - Create a brief summary of the new pipeline stages and their purpose in the project's `README.md`.",
  "## Next Steps\n": "- Schedule a kickoff meeting with the mentor to discuss the task details and success criteria.\n- Request the necessary permissions for the GitHub repository, including the ability to manage GitHub Actions secrets.\n- Begin the 'Preparation Stage' by cloning the repository and validating the local setup.",
  "## Resources & References\n": "- Project Documentation: `Project \"Nexus\" Document Version: 1.0`\n- Source Code: The Nexus backend service GitHub repository.\n- Technical Documentation: Official documentation for GitHub Actions, Pytest, and Docker.\n- Team Contact: Lead DevOps Engineer for the Nexus project.",
  "## Check List\n": "- [ ] Task plan reviewed and approved by mentor.\n- [ ] Static analysis step is implemented and functional in the CI pipeline.\n- [ ] Unit test and code coverage steps are implemented and reporting correctly.\n- [ ] Integration test step with a PostgreSQL service container is functional.\n- [ ] Pull Request is created, reviewed, and successfully merged.\n- [ ] Final documentation of the new pipeline stages is complete."
